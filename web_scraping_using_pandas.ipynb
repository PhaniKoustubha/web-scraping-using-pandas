            "Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket and the best of the 21st century.[3] He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018,  and 2019.[5]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings.[6] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.[7]\n",
            "\n",
            "He has received many accolades for his performances in cricket. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna award, in 2018.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable athletes, with estimated earnings of ₹634 crore (US$79 million) in the year 2022.\n",
            "\n",
            "Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[8]  Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[9] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[10]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[11] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[12] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[13] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[14] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[12]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[12][15] During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times.[9][16] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[12] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[17]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a match against the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs. His first half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Haryana.[18] By the end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[19] During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the Under-15 team. In his first match of the season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[20][21] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi Under-17 team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[22][23] Kohli commenced the 2005–06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[24] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[25]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 18 February 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[26] In 2006, Kohli had garnered enough attention to earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on 23 November 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs.[27] In a sequence of three matches, Kohli failed to score a fifty, leading his coaches to provide him with counselling. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. That very night, Kohli's father passed away at 3:54 a.m. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.[28] The team's coach, Chetan Chauhan was impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad also lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval.[29] Following his dismissal, Kohli attended his father's funeral. His innings, however, proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team's captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success.[29]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli's foray into T20 cricket took place in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship, where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[30] In September 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (reigning champions of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan). He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw, SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings.[31] In the 2009–10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharastra, he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory.[32] Kohli's performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit. Ashish Nehra observed his growth over time and shared his thoughts:[33]\n",
            "\n",
            "I did not see him waste his time. If not on the field, he would be busy in the gym. I saw him first as a chubby-cheeked bubbly young kid who grew into a perfect athlete. His junior cricket lessons have obviously helped him. I did not know him well, but had heard a lot about his exploits in junior cricket.\n",
            "In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s,[34] while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test series.[35] Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for profound technical prowess.[36] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the second match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings. He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore.[37]  In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India Under-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended in a draw, with a 1–1 score line. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. However, he made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.[38]\n",
            "\n",
            "In February–March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a batsman, amassing 235 runs in 6 games at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century.[39] His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as \"the innings of the tournament.\" This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award.[40] Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was significant to India's 3-wicket victory.[41] In the championship match, Kohli managed a modest score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s, his contribution lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).[42]\n",
            "\n",
            "In June of the year 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[43] In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament of 2008. Notably, his finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the national selectors who were observing his progress. He began his international cricket journey by joining the senior team in Colombo, having played 28 Under-19 ODIs and 12 Under-19 Tests.[44]\n",
            "\n",
            "In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[45] So, his selection was considered a \"surprise call-up\".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[48] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[49]\n",
            "\n",
            "Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[50] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[51] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[52]\n",
            "\n",
            "In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England. However, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[53] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$52,000 in 2023).[54] Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[55]\n",
            "\n",
            "In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title.[56][57] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli's performance during the tournament.[58] Kohli later stated that this tournament was a \"turning point\" in his career.[59]\n",
            "\n",
            "In August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[60] He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[61] In December of that year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka  and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI.[62] However, due to the reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely, which led to Kohli's return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata.[63] In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century–107 off 114 balls–while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3–1.[64][b]\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for the event.[65] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.[66] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66.[67] After the match, the Indian captain MS Dhoni stated about Kohli that \"he has grabbed his chances\" and that \"he has matured now.\" Dhoni went on to say that \"To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world.\"[68]\n",
            " Kohli's initial foray into leadership on an international level occurred in May–June 2010, when he was appointed as vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. This appointment came as many established players were rested for the tour. However, in the first match, Kohli was dismissed for a duck, without facing a single delivery, a rare and unusual mode of dismissal.[69] Despite this early setback, Kohli managed to become the fastest Indian batsman at the time to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, achieving this milestone in 24 innings.[70] Kohli also made his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26.[71] Later that month, during the 2010 Asia Cup, Kohli was included in the Indian team and was given the role of batting at number 3. However, his struggles with form started as he scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[72] This poor form was also reflected in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where his average was a mere 15.[73]\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite his recent struggles with form, Kohli was retained in the Indian ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October. In the only completed match of the series, held at Visakhapatnam, Kohli scored a century, earning him the man of the match award. He candidly acknowledged that he was under significant pressure to maintain his place in the team, given his previous failures in the preceding series.[74] During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored another match-winning century in the first match, marking his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession.[75] The Indian team emerged victorious with a 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand, and Kohli's exceptional performances in the series solidified his position in the ODI team and made him a strong candidate for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[76][77] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, accumulating 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38, including three centuries and seven half-centuries.[78]\n",
            "\n",
            "\"He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill.\"\n",

            " – Team India's coach Dav Whatmore at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup on Kohli, [79]\n",
            "Kohli was India's leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[80] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters,[81] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[82]\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli played every match of India's successful World Cup campaign.

Prior to the commencement of this season, he was highest run-scorer for Bangalore with a tally of 1,639 runs.[369] Kohli embarked on the tournament with a consistent start, but suffered a loss against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in an away game.[370] In their subsequent home match, once again against Hyderabad, Kohli scored unbeaten 93 while chasing, marking his highest individual score in Twenty20 cricket at that time.[371] Continuing his form, Kohli went on to score back-to-back fifties in the matches against the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Daredevils, the latter of which was decided through a super over.[372] After a defeat against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli found himself embroiled in a disagreement with the crowd due to their aggressive demeanour towards the visiting team at the Wankhede Stadium.[373] As the mid-season approached, Kohli encountered a dip in his performance, managing 45 runs in four innings.[374] He bounced back during the away game against Delhi, where he came close to achieving a century, scoring 99 before being run out on the final delivery.[375] With a strong start to the season that saw Bangalore occupying the top position in the table, the team's performance waned in the latter half of the tournament.[376] Kohli openly addressed the issue, attributing their decline to a lack of execution by the bowling unit.[377] In a bid to keep their playoff hopes alive, Bangalore confronted a must-win scenario in their final match against Chennai. Opening the innings, Kohli scored an unbeaten 56 in a rain-affected match, ultimately leading his team to victory.[378] However, Bangalore's hopes were shattered when the Hyderabad secured a win over the Kolkata Knight Riders, dashing their chances of advancing to the playoffs. As a result, Bangalore's season came to an end during the group stage.[379]\n",

            "Prior to the seventh season of the IPL, Kohli was retained by Bangalore for ₹12.5 crore (US$1.6 million).[380] His campaign commenced with an unbeaten score of 49 runs in a victorious encounter against the Delhi Daredevils.[381] However, Kohli struggled to maintain his form and faced a dismissal without scoring in the second match. In a match against the Rajasthan Royals, Bangalore's batting lineup faltered, resulting in them being bowled out for 70, then third-lowest total in IPL history. Kohli contributed 21 runs to the team's total in that particular match.[382] Bangalore heavily relied on the performances of Gayle and Kohli in their batting lineup, but neither of them had managed a significant innings thus far in the season.[383] Kohli's struggles persisted as he recorded his third duck of the season in a match against the Kings XI Punjab.[384] In an effort to address the batting woes, Kohli made the decision to alter his batting position and open the innings; however, this adjustment did not yield the desired outcome.[385] With Bangalore losing six out of their nine games, Kohli had yet to reach the milestone of scoring a half-century. Meanwhile, the team was striving to secure victories in their remaining matches in order to qualify for the playoffs.[383] In his twelfth game of the season against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kohli achieved his first fifty of the season. However, the subsequent defeat to the Kolkata Knight Riders, with Kohli contributing 38 runs before being dismissed by Sunil Narine for the second time, led to Bangalore's elimination from playoff contention for the third consecutive time.[386] In their final match of the season against the Chennai Super Kings, Kohli showcased his best performance of the season, accumulating 73 runs. However, Bangalore suffered a defeat in that match.[387] Despite the team's challenges, Kohli's popularity continued to soar, making him the most-searched player on the internet during the tournament.[388]\n",

            "At the outset of the 2015 season of the IPL, Kohli expressed his optimism about playing with reduced pressure, attributing it to the strengthened middle order of the Bangalore team.[389] Kohli strategically decided to open the batting alongside Gayle for the season. In the second match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, he scored 41 runs, providing a moderate start to his campaign.[390] Continuing his form, Kohli achieved his first half-century of the season, albeit in a match that ended in defeat against the Chennai Super Kings.[391] In the subsequent match, Kohli again notched a fifty, leading Bangalore to victory and ending their three-match losing streak.[392] During this match, he promoted AB de Villiers up the batting order, recognizing the importance of having the team's premier batsman face more deliveries.[393] Bangalore, looking to overcome their previous struggles in the bowling department, successfully bowled out the Delhi Daredevils for 95 runs, while Kohli guided his team to a ten-wicket victory during the chase.[394] However, in an away game against Chennai, Kohli fell short of reaching a half-century, scoring 48 runs before being run out by Dwayne Bravo due to a momentary lapse in judgment. Bangalore's loss in that match marked the end of their winning streak.[395] His standout innings of the season came against the Mumbai Indians, where he played a knock of 82 runs, forming a record-breaking 215-run partnership with de Villiers.[396] In a rain-affected match against the Hyderabad, with a target of 83 runs to chase in six overs, Kohli scored quickfire 44 off 19 balls, earning him player of the match award.[397] In the subsequent game, Kohli found himself entangled in an incident involving an anti-corruption code breach. Nonetheless, he managed to continue playing due to breach's absence of severity.[398] Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time under his captaincy, Kohli held firm confidence in the turnaround his team had showcased during the later stages of the league.[399] However, in the qualifier 2 against Chennai, Kohli's dismissal for 12 runs proved detrimental to Bangalore's chances, resulting in their defeat and the conclusion of their campaign for the season. Throughout the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 505 runs in 16 matches with an average of 45.90, then third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.[400]\n",

            "In the 2016 season of the IPL, Kohli's campaign began with 75 runs, contributing to a victory of 45 runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad.[401] He continued his run in the subsequent match, scoring 79 runs. Throughout the early matches, Kohli consistently achieved the milestone of scoring half-centuries in three out of the four matches he played, while sharing three century partnerships with de Villiers.[402] In the encounter against the Gujarat Lions, he registered his first century in Twenty20 cricket. Although the match ended in defeat for his team, Kohli's knock earned him the player of the match.[403] Despite Kohli's performances, Bangalore struggled in the league stage, securing only two victories out of their seven matches and finding themselves in the seventh position on the points table.[404] To revive their chances of qualifying for the playoffs, Bangalore needed to win six out of their next seven matches. In the subsequent match, Kohli scored a century in a successful chase against Rising Pune Supergiant as Bangalore's virtual knockouts began.[405] He continued to deliver match-winning performances, forming a record-breaking partnership of 229 runs with de Villiers against the Gujarat,[406] followed by playing a knock of 75* against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[407] In a rain-affected match against the Kings XI Punjab, Kohli achieved his fourth century of the season, surpassing the milestone of 4,000 runs in the league.[408] His batting drew high praise from Harsha Bhogle, who lauded his technical proficiency and shot-making.[409] Kohl's consistent performances propelled Bangalore to the playoffs, as he scored four consecutive fifty-plus scores in must-win matches and finished the league stage with tally of 919 runs.[410] In the playoffs, Bangalore faced Gujarat in the first qualifier. Kohli was dismissed for a duck in that match, however his team emerged victorious, setting up a final against the Hyderabad.[411] Kohli contributed 54 runs in Bangalore's pursuit of target of 209 in the final. Notwithstanding, Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, leaving him to acknowledge the Hyderabad team's performance and express his gratitude to the Bangalore crowd for their support.[412] Kohli concluded the season with record 973 runs in 16 matches, at an average of 81.08, establishing himself as the highest run-scorer of the tournament and claiming Orange Cap with the title of Most Valuable Player.[413] Team's coach, Vettori, praised Kohli for his contributions, stating:[414]\n",
            "\n",
            "Virat has been phenomenal. When you have got a guy at the top of the order who takes that much control and his performances are that great, it allows things to flow from there. Obviously a great captain does that — leads with his performance and he has been exceptional not only with his batting, but also fielding and leadership.\n",
            "In the lead-up to the tenth season of the IPL, Kohli grappled with a shoulder injury, which sidelined him for the initial three fixtures of the tournament.[415] Upon his return in the fourth match against the Mumbai Indians, he scored 62 runs, albeit in a defeat for Bangalore.[416] Following this performance, Kohli delivered moderately in the subsequent two matches. However, in the face-off against the Kolkata Knight Riders, Kohli faced a setback after being dismissed for a duck as Bangalore stumbled to league's lowest score of 49 runs. He promptly criticized the batting display as reckless.[417] In the encounter against the Rising Pune Supergiants, Kohli contributed 55 runs to his team's total of 96 runs. Expressing disappointment, Kohli attributed the team's struggles to a lack of intent and a fearful batting approach.[418] With Bangalore facing defeat in seven out of their ten matches, their hopes for playoffs were dashed, particularly after their loss to the Mumbai Indians, making them the first team to be eliminated from contention.[419] Wrapping up the tournament, Bangalore secured a victory in their last match against Delhi Daredevils, with Kohli scoring his fourth fifty of the season and amassing a total of 308 runs in 10 innings.[420] Kohli concluded that the season as a whole was the team's most underwhelming performance to date.[421] Commemorating the ten-year anniversary of the league, ESPN-Cricinfo honoured Kohli by including him in the all-time IPL-XI.[422]\n",

            "In the 2019 IPL season, Kohli etched his name in the annals of IPL history by reaching the milestone of 5000 runs, becoming only the second player to achieve this feat after Suresh Raina.[426] During the competition, the skipper also overtook Raina to become the leading run-scorer in IPL, scoring 84 against Kolkata Knight Riders.[427] His achievements were further magnified by the fact that he notched up his fifth IPL century, in an away match against the same opposition.[428] Despite his output, totalling 464 runs at a strike rate of 141.46, the Royal Challengers Bangalore struggled under Kohli's captaincy, ultimately finishing at the bottom of the league standings.[429]\n",

            "Upon the resumption of cricket following the COVID-19 lockdown, Kohli returned to the field with cautious optimism. Despite his five-month hiatus from the sport, he expressed surprise at the smoothness of his performance.[430] During the 2020 season, Kohli amassed 466 runs in 15 matches, averaging at 42.36 and striking at a rate of 121.35. This saw him take the 9th place among the tournament's highest run-scorers.[431] Royal Challengers Bangalore was eliminated in the eliminator match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, with Kohli's early dismissal in the second over at the hands of Jason Holder playing a significant role in their elimination.[432]\n",

            "In the first match of Bangalore in 2023 season, Kohli contributed to his team by scoring an unbeaten 82 runs against the Mumbai Indians.[440] Subsequently, owing to the temporary absence of regular captain Faf Du Plessis, Kohli assumed the captaincy responsibilities for a limited period.[441] Further into the season, in the tenth match against the Delhi Capitals, Kohli achieved a milestone by surpassing 7000 runs, becoming the first to do so.[442] During this season, Kohli adopted a strategic approach to his scoring, combining aggressive play in the powerplay with building a substantial innings. After a temporary lull in form, he scored a century against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, a crucial win as Bangalore needed three consecutive victories in their final matches to qualify.[443] In the subsequent match against the Gujarat Titans, Kohli scored another century, although the team suffered a defeat.

He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[448][449] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[450][451]\n",

            "Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[10] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[452] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[453] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.[454]\n",

            "However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[455] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[456] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[457][458] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[459][460] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[461]\n",

He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans, critics and former cricketers alike.[472][473] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[474][475] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[476] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[477] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and \"assertiveness\" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.[478]\n",

Dubbed as Tendulkar's \"successor\",[479][480] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[481][482] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[483] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[484] He has been lauded as the \"new king of world cricket\" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[485] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[486] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[487]\n",

This brand offers a range of sport-related apparel, footwear, and accessories designed for active individuals.[534] That same year, Kohli also established Nueva, a fine dining establishment located in New Delhi. The restaurant features a South American-inspired decor accentuated with Native American artwork, providing a distinctive culinary setting.[535] Kohli also established One8 Commune, a chain of restaurant-bars that offer a modern and sophisticated ambiance that appeals to a diverse age range. This marked his inaugural foray into the food and beverage industry. The first outlet of this restaurant was launched in 2017.[536]\n",

            "In 2022, Kohli and his spouse made an investment of ₹2.5 crore (equivalent to ₹2.9 crore or US$370,000 in 2023) in Digit, an insurance-based startup.[537] Additionally, they also extended their support to Blue Tribe, a startup that specializes in the production and distribution of plant-based meat products. Driven by his own inclination towards a plant-based diet, Kohli aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to adopt more sustainable and environmentally conscious practices.[538]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2013, Kohli established the \"Virat Kohli Foundation\" with a philanthropic objective to support underprivileged children.[539] The foundation collaborates with a selected group of NGOs to increase awareness and gather support for various causes that are instrumental in advancing their mission of promoting the welfare and well-being of these children.[540][541] In 2014, the foundation participated in a charity auction organized by eBay and Save the Children India, the proceeds of which were directed towards the education and healthcare of underprivileged children.[542] Kohli is dedicated to creating a brighter future for children by implementing sports-based programs and providing them with necessary resources, leveraging his connections and partnerships to uplift marginalized segments of society.[543]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli's foundation has organized several charity events to raise funds for its causes, including football matches featuring prominent Indian cricketers and Bollywood actors. The first such event was a celebrity football match in collaboration with Abhishek Bachchan's charity foundation, which drew significant media attention and was successful in raising funds.[544] In this match, Kohli captained the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, led by Abhishek Bachchan.[545] Another charity football match, dubbed the \"Celebrity Clasico\", was held in June 2016 in Mumbai, with Kohli once again leading the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, captained by Ranbir Kapoor. This event was also a major success in generating funds for charitable causes.[546]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2016, the Virat Kohli Foundation entered into a partnership with Smile Foundation to promote the empowerment of underprivileged children and young people. To kickstart this initiative, Kohli organized a philanthropic dinner at Grand Hyatt, Mumbai, graced by the presence of cricketing luminaries such as MS Dhoni, Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Ajinkya Rahane, and KL Rahul to support the cause of child and youth empowerment.[547] To advance the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), which aims at creating a cleaner India, Kohli and the Indian cricket team, in collaboration with Anurag Thakur, undertook a cleaning initiative at the Eden Gardens on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti of 2016.[548]\n",
            "\n",
            "Prior to a match against Sri Lanka in the 2017 Champions Trophy, Kohli hosted a benevolent gala event in London in support of the Justice and Care organization. The ball was arranged with the objective of increasing both funds and awareness for the humanitarian cause championed by Justice and Care. The organization endeavors to combat the pernicious issues of human trafficking and contemporary slavery.[549] In 2017, Kohli established the Athlete Development Programme (ADP) as a platform for nurturing and supporting aspiring young athletes. This initiative provides comprehensive guidance to these young athletes in areas such as coaching, training, fitness, competition, and nutrition, thereby fostering their growth and development. The program has proven beneficial to several young sports persons, including tennis player Swastika Ghosh and golfer Aadil Bedi.[550]\n",
            "\n",
            "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma pledged donations to the PM CARES Fund and the Maharashtra CM Relief Fund.[551] The couple has a strong passion for animal welfare and have made personal contributions towards wildlife relief efforts. Through his support of Awaaz, Kohli seeks to provide comprehensive medical services, shelter, and sustenance to stray animals.[552]\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Kohli holds a prominent place in the annals of Indian cricket. He has the distinction of being the only cricketer to have been named the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup on two separate occasions, in 2014 and 2016.[215] In terms of ODI centuries, he ranks first with 50.[554] He surpassed Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 49 ODI tons and achieved this feat on 15 November 2023 in the semifinal of the 2023 Cricket World Cup, while also becoming the first player to score more than 700 runs in a single edition of the tournament.[555] Furthermore, in international cricket, Kohli has amassed 80 centuries, second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 100 centuries.[556] In 2018, Kohli set a record, becoming the first player to score 1,000 ODI runs in 11 innings in a calendar year.[557] In 2022, he achieved another milestone by scoring 1,000 runs in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, becoming the second player to reach this feat after Mahela Jayawardene.[558] During the match against Bangladesh, he became the top-scorer in the history of T20 World Cup.[559]\n",
